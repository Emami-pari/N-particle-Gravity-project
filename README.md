# N-Body Gravity Simulation

A numerical simulation of gravitational interactions between **N particles (stars)** using **C++** for computation and **Mathematica** for visualization.  
The project studies **orbital dynamics**, **stellar mergers**, and **system stability** in multi-body gravitational systems.
